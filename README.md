# Movie API
An **HTML** program using a movie *API* (JavaScript) fetches and displays movie details dynamically. It utilizes JavaScript to make API requests and update the webpage with movie titles, posters, and descriptions. Users can search for movies, filter results, and view ratings. This enhances the websiteâ€™s functionality by integrating real-time movie data.
